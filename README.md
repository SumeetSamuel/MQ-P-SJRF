# MQ-P-SJRF
Design a scheduler with multilevel queue having two queues which will schedule the processes on the basis of  pre-emptive shortest remaining processing time first algorithm (SROT) followed by a scheduling in which each process will get 2 units of time to execute. Also note that queue 1 has higher priority than queue 2.
